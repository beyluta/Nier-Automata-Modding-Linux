# Nier-Automata-Modding-Linux

This is a tutotial for modding nier automata on linux (works on Arch and Fedora confirmed, but should work on any distro)

You can either follow the tutorial for auto installing everything 

First of all, copy the repo, then follow one of the two methods


## INSTALLER METHOd
1) Run the install-prerequisites.sh file
     Your Nier Automata folder should now have this files (entries anding in / are folders)
     1) d3d11.dll                         (SpecialK dll)
     3) d3d11.ini                         (SpecialK config)
     4) data/
     5) FAR.ini                           (Fix Automata Resolution config)
     6) logs/                             (SpecialK logs folder)
     7) NierAutomata.exe                  (This is the Wolf-Limit-Breaker exe)
     8) NierAutomata(original).exe        (Original game exe)
     9) SK_Res                            (SpecialK folder for textures)
     10) steam_api64.sll
     11) Wallpaper

2) You can now install any mod you want by following the tutorials on nexus mods.
   Some mods (those that require Windows specific stuff) are probably not made for Linux and
   will therefore not work, I will not cover them because I do not know the entire mod list
   by memory (obviously)

3) You can run my install-important-mods.sh file for installing the mods that I believe are
   important for everyone 

  

## Manual installation
This is process is longer because it is less automated, but if anything doesn't work you will notice immediatly and will know exactly what broke it

### STEP 1 - Installing the prerequisites for modding the game
## STEP 2 - Installing Mods
